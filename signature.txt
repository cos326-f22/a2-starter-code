In doing this homework I used the following sources:

1. Sources I don't need to mention   [see notes 1 and 4]
2. Authorized sources  [see notes 2 and 4]
   [list here]
3. Unauthorized sources [see notes 3 and 4]
   [list here]

This paper represents my own work in accordance with University regulations.

Signed, [your name(s):]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1:   Sources you don't need to mention
  (unless you paste code from them verbatim) include:
  this semester's lectures and precepts,  the course web site,
  the assignment handout (download), Real World OCaml, and the OCaml manual.

NOTE 2:  Authorized sources include:
    professors and preceptors (outside of lecture or precept);
    advice from other students (but not looking at their solutions
    to this course's homeworks);
    other books, and (within reason) web sites such as stackoverflow.com
    (for general questions about OCaml bugs, not for solutions to
    the homework).
  List by name, by URL, or by bibliographic citation, as appropriate.

NOTE 3:  "Why would I list an unauthorized source?"
  Using an unauthorized source without citing it is an Academic Violation
  under Princeton University's disciplinary code, and can result
  in suspension from the University for one or more semesters.

  Using an unauthorized source and citing it clearly is not an Academic
  Violation, it is "merely" a violation of this homework's instructions,
  and can result in (at most) getting a zero on this homework.

  Unauthorized sources include, at least: other people's solutions
  to these (or similar) homework problems.

NOTE 4.  If you paste in code from from these sites,
  you should clearly cite it at the point of use, in accordance with
  Section 2.4.6 of RRR  for "direct quotation or extensive paraphrase".

  Please limit the amount of this that you do in accordance with the
  principle that the purpose of these homeworks is so that you
  can learn how to do things yourself.
